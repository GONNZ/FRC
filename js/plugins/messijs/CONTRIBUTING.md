How to Contribute to MessiJS
============================

I welcome all contributions to MessiJS.  Please send me a pull
request.  I do reserve the right of determining what features will
go into MessiJS.

**NOTE:** I believe that well-formatted, well-tested, well-structured
code is a joy to use and a joy to develop.  Please include Mocha
tests with bug reports (where possible) and especially with new
features.

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

1. `git clone https://github.com/MessiJS/MessiJS.git`
2. `npm install`
3. Download a copy of `jquery.min.js` into the root of the folder. E.g. `wget http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js`
4. Add tests for your Issue or New Feature.
5. `<coding happens here>`
6. Run `gulp lint`
7. Correct any javascript syntax problems that this finds.
8. Run `gulp test`
9. Verify all tests are passing
10. When your new code passes lint validation and your new test(s) are passing, send me a Pull Request.

Yes, it's that easy. :wink:
